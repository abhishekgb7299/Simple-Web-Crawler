# Simple-Web-Crawler
The task is to count the most frequent words, which extracts data from dynamic sources.  First, create a web-crawler with the help of requests module and beautiful soup module, which will extract data from the web-pages and store them in a list. There might be some undesired words or symbols (like special symbols, blankspaces), which can be filtered inorder to ease the counts and get the desired results. After counting each word, we also can have the count of most (say 10 or 20) frequent words.
